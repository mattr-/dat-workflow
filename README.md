Notes/Ideas/Code around my ideal workflow

**This is just a braindump.**

All the "normal" task systems break down for me in some regard and I just fail to use them. I fully recognize that this is a failing of discipline on my part. At the same time, I feel like there's a way to get something put together that I can actually use, but I'd better document it first.

I've used GTD with success in the past, so a lot of the terms will use those meanings and I imagine the final result will look something like GTD.

### Data Entry

Need a way to get things in simply. I use Alfred, and Cmd-Space is my hotkey, so it'd better be hooked into that. The trigger needs to be something simple but semi-obscure. Use `.` or maybe a `'` to indicate a new entry.

New entries go straight into the inbox. Nowhere else. I just need that shit out of my brain so I can go back to task at hand.

What about paper? No. I have to move my hands off the keyboard.

New idea is a command called 'todo'. One is an Alfred version and another for the command line. Need to resolve how to add items vs. starting the interface that does the reviewing

### Reviewing entries

Entries are two things. Single tasks that are easy to complete (i.e. Take out the trash) or projects that aren't (i.e. Plan a vacation).

Inbox review creates tasks that go somewhere - such as a context or an existing planned project - or unplanned projects, which I'll get into next.

### Unplanned projects

GTD has this idea of a natural planning process, which I like. Ideally, as I review unplanned projects, there's something that helps me figure out what to actually do for the project that frames things in that way. 

### Planned projects

Planned projects are just projects that have been through the above planning process. They should probably have some tasks.
