Notes/Ideas/Code around my ideal workflow

Right now, this is just a braindump.

All the "normal" task systems break down for me in some regard and I just fail to use them. I fully recognize that this is a failing of discipline on my part. At the same time, I feel like there's a way to get something put together that I can actually use, but I'd better document it first.

I've used GTD with success in the past, so a lot of the terms will use those meanings and I imagine the final result will look something like GTD.
