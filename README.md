Notes/Ideas/Code around my ideal workflow

Right now, this is just a braindump.

All the "normal" task systems break down for me in some regard and I just fail to use them. I fully recognize that this is a failing of discipline on my part. At the same time, I feel like there's a way to get something put together that I can actually use, but I'd better document it first.

I've used GTD with success in the past, so a lot of the terms will use those meanings and I imagine the final result will look something like GTD.

### Data Entry

Need a way to get things in simply. I use Alfred, and Cmd-Space is my hotkey, so it'd better be hooked into that. The trigger needs to be something simple but semi-obscure. Use `.` or maybe a `'` to indicate a new entry.

New entries go straight into the inbox. Nowhere else. I just need that shit out of my brain so I can go back to task at hand.

What about paper? No. I have to move my hands off the keyboard.

### Reviewing entries

Entries are two things. Single tasks that are easy to complete (i.e. Take out the trash) or projects that aren't (i.e. Plan a vacation).

Inbox review creates tasks that go somewhere - such as a context or an existing planned project - or unplanned projects, which I'll get into next.
